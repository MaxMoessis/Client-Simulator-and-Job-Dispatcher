# Project: Stage 1
Currently, all that is in this repository is the client that I created in the week5 workshop. 
This client successfully does some part of the job already.
It: 

1. Says HELO to the DS-server and processes authentication 
2. Runs a 'GETS All' and collects the number of servers that is returned
3. Starts a loop that finds the first largest server and then displays it's ID and how many cores it has. 
4. Disconnects with the server. 

My plan at this first stage is to make some functions that simplify the message sending process so the code looks a lot neater. 
Then the next step will be starting the LaTeX report and figuring out how to properly schedule jobs by studying the user manual.
