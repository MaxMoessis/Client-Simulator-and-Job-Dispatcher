## How to use this client (LRR.java)
**There is a class file included, however I recommend compiling LRR.java yourself.**

1. Make sure you have 2 terminals open, one containing the ds-server and the other containing this client (LRR).
2. Start the server using any config files you desire 
Example:
    ./ds-server -c ds-sample-config01.xml -n -v brief 

3. Then compile and run LRR.java 

$   javac LRR.java

$   java LRR

4. The client will schedule and complete all the jobs desired in the chosen config file.
